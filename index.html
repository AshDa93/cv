<h3>Early Life</h3>
I was born on the 05th of December 1993 and i'm the fourth child out of 5 siblings.
Growing up, especially in an environment where the odds of amounting to
being someone who will make an impact on someone else's life was close to
none. My first year of schooling was the hardest period in my life since I was
a shy child. I was bullied and had a very low self-esteem and it got to a point
where I felt that school wasn't made for me. I would always find ways to skip
school for a few days. Ironically, I was amongst the smartest kids in class
and excelled in every subject. By the time I got to high school I had changed
three schools, namely:
  <ul>
<li>Thabeng Primary School (Grade 1 to 4)</li>
<li>Moloantoa Primary School (Grade 5 to 7)</li>
<li>Lakeside Secondary School (grade 8 to 12) </li>
</ul>
